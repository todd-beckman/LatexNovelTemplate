# LaTeX Novel Format

This is a personal project that I don't mind sharing with the world. The purpose is that I want to be able to edit text without worrying about formatting, while keeping the files in sync between Mac and Windows/Ubuntu Dual OS's. Here were my options:

- Scrivener is my writing software of choice, but I don't have both Mac and Windows licenses, and keeping the project files in sync would be a nightmare over Dropbox/Drive anyway.

- Microsoft Word does not have any native support for joining documents together and is very bloated/slow. I also don't have both Mac and Windows licenses.

- Google Drive has the annoying "feature" where backspacing will remove autoindenting and pressing "tab" will sometimes insert the character rather than resuming autoindentation. It loads the entire file into memory, so larger files can cause a lot of lag.

- Latex is supported by all operating systems and offers exactly what I needed. Additionally, the writing files (which need not have any extra code in them) can be easily imported into any of the above options at any time. I have complete control over the output format, including having a very easy switch (`\manuscript`) between the bare-bones format and the pretty format for all to read.

So naturally I went that route.
